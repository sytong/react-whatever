# Graphene Asset List
This is a very simple page that displays the asset list from [OpenLedger](https://bitshares.openledger.info/) using the [Graphene Websocket library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphenejs-ws).

# Notes
* Using [react-router](https://react-router.now.sh/)
  * The connection to the graphene websocket is established in the `onEnter` hook.
